# Introduction to Node.js 

This is a comprehensive list of resources to help a developer go from Node.js novice to professional ready to slay the dragon that is Communicode development. Hopefully you enjoy yourself along the way. It's pretty fun.

The tutorials are separated into three groups: 

 1. Text/Articles
 2. Video Tutorials
 3. (Free!) Courses

Choose which ever one suits you best. Or do all of them. Doesn't matter to me.
